                    "question": "How far in advance should we book?",
                    "answer": "We recommend reaching out 8–12 months before your wedding date to ensure availability. Our calendar fills quickly, especially during peak wedding season (October–February). For destination weddings, earlier booking is ideal so we can plan logistics together."
                },

                    "question": "What is the booking process?",
                    "answer": "It begins with a conversation. After an initial call to understand your vision, we send a tailored proposal. A signed agreement and a 30% retainer secure your date. From there, we stay in close touch leading up to your big day."
                },

                    "question": "Can we meet before booking?",
                    "answer": "Of course. We love meeting our couples in person or over a video call. It's important that we connect — after all, we'll be by your side on one of the most intimate days of your life."

                    "answer": "We blend into your celebration. Our style is unobtrusive and documentary — we capture real moments as they unfold, not manufactured ones. That said, we do set aside a short window for intimate portraits that feel natural and timeless."

                    "answer": "Yes, and we highly recommend them. A pre-wedding session helps us build rapport and understand your chemistry. It also gives you a chance to get comfortable in front of the lens before the big day."

                {
                    "question": "What should we wear or prepare?",
                    "answer": "We provide a detailed style guide and a planning timeline ahead of your session. Our only real advice: be yourselves. The most beautiful photographs come from authentic emotion, not perfect outfits."
