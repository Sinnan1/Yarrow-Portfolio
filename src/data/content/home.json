      "description": "Second marriage, for many, is still a taboo. And this story illustrates why it's not. It's a treatise on how the past doesn't come in the way of love and respect. It's a heroic tale of victory over stereotypes and archaic customs. It's a story of how love always triumphs in the end. Every moment that we spent with Deepali and Nishant convinced us that life can be made beautiful... that tears can be turned into a drizzle of hope; that fear can be turned into the excitement of exploring the unknown; that the end is but a new beginning."

      "description": "This one is special, very special. Hiba and Akbar's story took us on a journey all the way from Hiba's childhood till their reception in Bhopal and on the way we discovered an all new perspective of filming a wedding. We knew from start that no matter how hard we try we can never justify this wedding in a 5 minute film, but we tried, tried for an year now and this is the best we could do. Its a film which is not just about a wedding, an India Pakistan story which is not about India or Pakistan. For us its much more than that."
