## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I need to provide all 12 wedding galleries at once?**
A: No! You can start with 4-6 galleries and add more over time. The site will work with fewer galleries.

**Q: What if I don't have professional team photos?**
A: You can use working photos (photos of team members at weddings) or wait to add the team section later.

**Q: Can I use the same images in multiple places?**
A: It's better to use unique images for each section, but some overlap is acceptable (e.g., using a gallery image as a thumbnail).

**Q: What if my wedding descriptions are shorter than 150 words?**
A: That's fine! The word counts are guidelines. Quality matters more than hitting exact word counts.

**Q: Do I need to provide all vendor credits?**
A: Vendor credits are optional but recommended as they add authenticity and can help with SEO and networking.
