## 💡 QUICK TIPS

1. **Don't have everything?** Start with Phase 1. You can launch with just the essentials and add more later.

2. **Image quality matters:** Use high-resolution, professionally shot images. Avoid phone photos or low-quality images.

3. **Be authentic:** Your story, pricing, and policies should be genuine and reflect your actual business.

4. **Reuse smartly:** You can use the same couple's images in multiple places (thumbnail + full gallery), but try to use different photos.

5. **Client consent:** Make sure you have permission to use all client photos and testimonials publicly.

6. **Keep it updated:** Plan to update galleries and testimonials regularly with recent work.
